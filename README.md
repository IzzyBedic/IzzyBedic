## Hello!

## My name is Izzy Bedichek

## Interests
My two main interests are animal ecology and sustainable resource allocation. I find herpetofauna especially interesting and want to use data science to aid wildlife conservation efforts. 
I am also fascinated by how humans live and how we design our food and shelter systems. I would love to one day work to optimize cities and farms' resource usage. Additionally, I love to write, and want to combine data science and science writing to increase awareness in climate change issues.
